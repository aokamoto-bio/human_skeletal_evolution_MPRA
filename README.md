Code for the preprint:

COMING SOMEDAY

Initial processing of the sequencing data was performed on the Harvard FAS computing cluster. Other parts of this script were written for a smaller, internal lab computing cluster. It may not work on a personal computer.

The code provided here is exactly what was run to perform these analyses but may not run on another system without modifications to ensure proper software, computational power, and directory structures. Please reach out to me at aokamoto@g.harvard.edu if you wish to replicate these analyses and the provided code is insufficient. I will try to help you to the best of my abilities.
